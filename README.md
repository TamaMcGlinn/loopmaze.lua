# ComputerCraft LoopMaze creator

I wrote this lua program in 2011 but recently revisited it to improve and publish it for your enjoyment. If you haven't already, install ComputerCraft (or ComputerCraftEdu), create a turtle and checkout this repository into your ComputerCraft computer's directory in `.minecraft/saves`. For me, that is at `~/.minecraft/saves/Boston_58605896859/computer/7`. Position the turtle over a chest full of your desired construction material and run the script.
